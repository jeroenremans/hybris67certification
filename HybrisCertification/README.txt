The index.html is the starting point. Make sure that your browser supports loading files from your file system. (Firefox seems to work out of the box).

All the questions are located in the json directory.


How to keep track of you answers:
---------------------------------
1) Create a new excel file
2) Load the questions
3) In the console all the question numbers will be logged. Copy this list to the excel file.
4) If you answered a question correctly, update the excel with "X" in the second row.
5) Afterwards you can copy the 2 columns (questionnumbers and answers X/O) to the "filter question" section in the index.html
6) Click on "Filter Questions" to filter the displayed questions.


If you think questions are not correct. Or are not relevant you can update the questions or contact me (jeroen.remans@continuum.be)
